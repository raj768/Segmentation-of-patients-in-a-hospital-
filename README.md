# Segmentation-of-patients-in-a-hospital-


## Overview
This project demonstrates patient segmentation using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python. It helps categorize patients into various risk groups based on their various features like Age, Comorbodities, Vital Signs and Laboratory results, allowing healthcare providers to tailor their care and resources accordingly.

## Methodology
Data Preparation: The script loads the patient data and standardizes it using StandardScaler.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data to two principal components.

Determine Optimal Clusters: The Elbow Method is used to find the optimal number of clusters for K-means.

K-means Clustering: K-means is applied with the selected number of clusters to segment patients.

Visualization: The results are visualized using a scatter plot, which displays patients' segmentation based on Age, Comorbodities, Vital Signs and Laboratory results.


## Results
The project provides a basic patient segmentation example. Adjust it for your specific dataset, features, and requirements. The script creates clusters based on your data and displays the results through a scatter plot.
